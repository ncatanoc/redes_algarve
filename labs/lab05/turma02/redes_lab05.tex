\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*, label=\textbf{Q\arabic*}, itemsep=-5pt]
\item You listen to a presentation about a new network protocol for
  online banking. After the talk, there is a lot of discussion going
  on. Check all the remarks that are relevant under the \textbf{Dolev-Yao} model.  
  \begin{enumerate}[itemsep=-3.5pt, label={}]
   \item[\incorrectOption] The bank runs Windows on their servers. This will
    be insecure.
   \item[\incorrectOption] It looks nice, the NSA (National Security Agency)
    will break the encryption function and use this to spy on us.
    \item[\incorrectOption] What happens if someone breaks into the bank's
    data center? They should use a blockchain instead!
    \item[\incorrectOption] I don't think they properly protect against
    transaction replay.
   \end{enumerate}

\item For each network capability, which goal is {\bf{}directly}
  violated? {\bf{}Only check one goal} - the most directly violated
  one per capability.

\item For their new blockchain-based  cryptocurrency venture,
  FooBank's CTO wants to get rind of all that unwanted software code
  and build revolutionary high-speed banking protocol directly on top
  of IP pakets. They propose the following protocol for money
  transfers between two different bank branches: \\
  ``\textcolor{blue}{ I first send you a packet with information of the receiver,
  then a packet with information of the amount, and then a
  packet with information of the recipient. Trust me, it's the
  best protocol we ever had!}''.

What could possibly go wrong? 
  \begin{enumerate}[itemsep=-3.5pt, label={}]
  \item[\incorrectOption]  Some transfers may inexplicably fail.
  \item[\incorrectOption]  Instead of sending money from Alice to Bob, FooBank may end
      up sending money from Bob to Alice.
    \item[\incorrectOption]  Mischievous attackers may get rich.
    \item[\incorrectOption]  Someone in Russia may get wind of it.
    \end{enumerate}

  \item Check all statements that are true about BGPs.\\
  \begin{enumerate}[itemsep=-3.5pt, label={}]
  \item[\incorrectOption]  The confidentiality of our communications
    can be asserted by physically protecting all fiber cables (in the
    world) on the default path.  
  \item[\incorrectOption] Securing BGP communications \textbf{today}
    is mostly an \textbf{afterthought} due to the fact that threat
    models have changed from the old Arpanet to the modern Internet.
  \item[\incorrectOption]  When leaving a spouse (home), one should
    reconfigure their BGP routes to protect her against stalking.
