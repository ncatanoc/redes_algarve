\homework{Redes II}{10-Sep-2024}{Lab \#1{}}

\noindent
The goal of this first lab was primarily to introduce you to Wireshark. The following
questions will demonstrate that you’ve been able to get Wireshark up and running, and
have explored some of its capabilities. Answer the following questions, based on your
Wireshark experimentation:

\bigskip

\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item List 3 different protocols that appear in the protocol column in the unfiltered
  packet-listing window in step 7 in document
  \texttt{re\-des\_\-lab01\_\-full.\-pdf}. Include a screen-shot of
  WireShark shows. \smallskip

  \label{fig:answer:1}
\end{figure}



  \item How long did it take from when the HTTP GET message was sent until the HTTP OK
    reply was received? (By default, the value of the Time column in the packet- listing
    window is the amount of time, in seconds, since Wireshark tracing began. To display
    the Time field in time-of-day format, select the Wireshark View pull down menu, then
    select Time Display Format, then select Time-of-day.) Include a screen-shot of
  WireShark shows. \smallskip

  \label{fig:answer:2}
\end{figure}


  \item What is the Internet address of the \texttt{gaia.cs.umass.edu} (also known as
    www-net.cs.umass.edu)? What is the Internet address of your computer?  Include a screen-shot of
  WireShark shows. \smallskip

\end{figure}

      
\item Print the two HTTP messages (GET and OK) referred to in question 2 above. To do
      so, select Print from the Wireshark File command menu, and select the “Selected
      Packet Only” and “Print as displayed” radial buttons, and then click OK. Include a screen-shot of
  WireShark shows. \smallskip
