\homework{Redes II}{DueDateGoesHere}{Lab \#2{}}

\noindent
Albert went to a Networking conference in which he was contacted to analyse the Wireshark network
file capture at \href{https://github.com/ncatanoc/redes\_algarve/blob/main/labs/lab02/conference.pcapng}{conference.pcapng}.

\bigskip

\noindent Help Albert analyse the network traffic with WireShark! The goal of this challenge is
  to get comfortable with WireShark; you don't need to understand everything yet.
  
\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item How many packets were captured? Justify your answer (where did
  you need to click to get that information?).  \\
  \begin{tabular}{|l|l|}\hline
    {\bf{}Measurement} &  {\bf{}Captured} \\ \hline
    Packets & XXX \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}\\
  %
\item How many TCP streams? Justify your answer (where did
  you need to click to get that information?).\\
  \begin{tabular}{|l|}\hline
    {\bf{}TCP Streams} \\ \hline
    XXX \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}\\
\item Which domain belonged to 81.166.122.238 at the time of capture? Justify your answer (where did
  you need to click to get that information?).  \\
  \begin{tabular}{|l|l|}\hline
    {\bf{}IP} &  {\bf{}Name Resolution} \\ \hline
    81.166.122.238 & XXX \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}\\
  
\item What's the capture date?  \\  
  \begin{tabular}{|l|l|}\hline
    {\bf{}First packet}: & XXX \\ \hline
    {\bf{}Last packet}:  & XXX \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}\\  
  %
\item Which operating system did Albert use during the event? Justify your answer (where did
  you need to click to get that information?). \\
  \begin{tabular}{|l|l|}\hline
    {\bf{}OS}: & XXX \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
  
\end{enumerate}
